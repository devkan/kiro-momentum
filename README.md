# DevOps Nightmare Dashboard

A browser-based productivity dashboard that transforms from a peaceful, Momentum-style interface into a horror-themed nightmare based on simulated server health status.

All information is stored in local storage and is not saved separately in a database. AWS integration is currently configured with dummy data, and some code modifications may be required when connecting with actual API keys.

See [AWS_SETUP.md](./AWS_SETUP.md) for detailed AWS configuration instructions.

### Horror Theme Modes

The dashboard transforms based on a "health score" (0-100):

- **Peaceful Mode** (Health 80-100%): Clean, calming interface
- **Glitch Mode** (Health 40-79%): Visual distortions and glitch effects
- **Nightmare Mode** (Health 0-39%): Full horror experience with scary visuals and sounds

The health score is calculated from:
- **AWS Mode**: Server status, error logs, and CPU metrics
- **Hacker News Mode**: Story scores and comment activity

### Audio Features

The AudioManager component provides immersive horror sound effects in Nightmare Mode:

- **Automatic Playback**: Sounds play automatically when entering Nightmare Mode
- **Mute/Unmute Toggle**: User control over audio playback
- **Autoplay Handling**: Graceful handling of browser autoplay restrictions with manual play option
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works seamlessly even if audio files are missing
- **Audio Files**: Place MP3 files in `public/audio/` directory (see `public/audio/README.md` for details)

## Theme Configuration

The Tailwind configuration includes custom extensions for horror modes:

- Custom fonts: Roboto (peaceful), Creepster & Nosifer (horror)
- Custom animations: glitch, flicker, pulse-red
- Custom colors: nightmare-red, glitch-gray
- Horror-specific utilities: vignette effects, scanlines

## Testing Strategy
